    <h3>Description.</h3>
        <p>Bangers and mash gets its name because sausages used to bang or burst while cooking. Mash, meanwhile, refers to the mashed potatoes. This recipe was a staple at our home in Dublin at Halloween. It is a very cheap, very traditional supper, and one that truly requires good sausage. Please note that this is a very thin gravy, as is traditional. It will still be very liquidy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 links pork sausage</li>
            <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cups red wine</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cook sausages in a skillet over medium-low heat until browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to an oven-safe dish and keep warm in the preheated oven.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place potatoes into a saucepan over medium heat and cover with water; bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mix in 1/4 cup of butter, milk, dry mustard, salt, and black pepper; mash until fluffy and smooth. Set aside.</p>

            <li>

Pour in beef broth and red wine; bring to a boil and simmer until reduced to half its volume, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.</p>
            </li>
